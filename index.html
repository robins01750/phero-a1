        </h1>
            <h3 class="dec">
                Across East Africa, millions of people are facing famine. A severe climate-crisis-induced drought is causing the dire situation, coupled with regional conflict, the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and soaring food prices tied to the war in Ukraine. Your donation to the East Africa Hunger Relief Fund will provide emergency relief, food, water, medicine, and other essential supplies to people in need.
